# Sales Dashboard
- The project consists of analyzing sales data from several cities in Brazil, with the aim of identifying which products were the most sold (in quantity and revenue) and which stores sold the most (in revenue). The project will later be improved, adding new graphs and suggestions for business decisions based on the results. This repository also has signatures on each commit (verification seal).
